FORMATTING FILES:

A formatting file is a valid html file containing keywords that are enclosed in square braces (ex. [NAME], [/FORMAT]).
The file is processed right before it is sent. The plugin replaces instances of keywords and text between keywords
with the appropriate content. The keywords currently supported are:

KEYWORD(s)				VALUE					
[NAME], [/NAME]			The name of the formatting file must come between these two tags. Whitespace before and after 
						the name is ignored.
[FORMAT], [/FORMAT]		The actual HTML content comes between these two tags.
[POST]					The content of the post is put in place of this tag.
[TITLE]					The title of the post is put in place of this tag.
[AUTHOR]				The author of the post is put in place of this tag.
[POST_IMG]				If the post has a featured image, it is put in place of this tag. Otherwise, the keyword is
						just replaced with an empty string ("")
[IMAGE], [/IMAGE]		The keywords and any text between are replaced with a chosen image. The url 
						(the 'img src' attribute) for a desired image should be placed between the keywords.

All styling must occur within the file; using the <style> tags is ideal. Since CSS ids and classes aren't added
to the text that replaces keywords, keywords can be wrapped with <span> tags to allow appropriate styling.

example (this just prints out the selected post with all the text made red):
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
<style>

#post-content p {
	color: red;
}

</style>
</head>

<span id="post-content>
<p> [POST] </p>
</span>

</html>

EMAIL GROUPS:

There are only two parts to making email group files (which are simple text files):
	- the name of the email group always comes on the first line
	- each line after the first is a single valid email address that the parsed formatting file will be sent to

example:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Test Email Group
john@gmail.com
suzy@hotmail.com
mom@aol.com
other_people@gmail.com
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
